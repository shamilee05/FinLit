**Learn Finance with Fun!**

FinLit is our attempt to make the process of improving your **financial literacy** innovative and fun! Our application consists of quizzes which employ Machine Learning concepts like the **Naive-Bayes** algorithm and **Fuzzy Logic** which determine your knowledge level and modify the difficulty level of the quizzes accordingly - hence our quizzes are completely customised to your learning and growth! Finding the quizzes too tough to crack? Worry not, we have **Info Bites** to help you learn concepts and gain knowledge before attempting the quizzes. What's more? You also get to spread word about the app using our **Facebook Share** feature. This way you can invite your friends to use the app and game up against each other to see who scores the highest! 

**Domains: Banking, Tax, Loans, Investments**
Upto 160 questions and concepts to learn and crack!
