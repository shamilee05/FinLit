**Learn Finance with Fun!**

FinLit is our attempt to make the process of improving your **financial literacy** innovative and fun! Our application consists of quizzes which employ Machine Learning concepts like the **Naive-Bayes** algorithm and **Fuzzy Logic** which determine your knowledge level and modify the difficulty level of the quizzes accordingly - hence our quizzes are completely customised to your learning and growth! Finding the quizzes too tough to crack? Worry not, we have **Info Bites** to help you learn concepts and gain knowledge before attempting the quizzes. What's more? You also get to spread word about the app using our **Facebook Share** feature. This way you can invite your friends to use the app and game up against each other to see who scores the highest! 

**Domains: Banking, Tax, Loans, Investments**
Upto 160 questions and concepts to learn and crack!

Since, our application is a **Progressive Web Application or PWA**, you can use it on any device - Laptop, Desktop, Mobile phone - regardless!

- An **Initiation quiz** is a **9-question no-timer, no-hint quiz** that simply aims to understand how much you already know about finance, specifically Banking. We will classify you into 1 of our 3 levels - **Beginner, Intermediate or Expert** based on your results:

- After you are registered/logged in, you will be redirected to the Dashboard. The **Dashboard** is where you can attempt more quizzes, view your progress and check out the Facebook share feature! We have 4 domains on our application. Choose whichever you want to start attempting the quizzes for. If you continue with Banking, you will be directed to the **Secondary quiz**. As for the other domains, you will need to attempt the Initiation quizzes for them before proceeding to the Secondary quizzes:

- The **Secondary quiz** is a **continuous, 30-second-per-question quiz wherein we will be giving you hints (wherever required) and explanations!** You will be continuously assessed at every stage of the quiz and will be shown intermediate results as below:

For every question, you will be awarded **15 points if you answer within the first 10 seconds, 10 points if you answer within 20 seconds, 5 points if you answer within 30 seconds and 0 if you answer correctly but take beyond 30 seconds**. Don't worry though, we won't deduct anything from your scores if you answer incorrectly. Answer as much correctly as you can and you will score more points and ultimately become an expert in finances!
